## FW/1 2.2 Resource Routes and renderData example

A simple example of using the new Resource Routes and renderData in FW/1 to create a REST API and consume this with Javascript.

Tested on Railo 4.1, should run on ACF (except the tests), but really you're probably only just going to browse the code instead of running it.

Not totally finished, but I thought I'd get it out there all the same:

## TODO

 * list count doesn't get updated when a new item is added
 * not much error handling
 * rewrite UI using [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) as a coding exercise
 * probably a bunch of other bugs
